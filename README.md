# advent-of-code-2022

This repository is my attempt at Advent of Code for 2022!

This year I'm attempting AoC in Ruby, a language I have several years of experience in.
I'm doing this because I'm going to be quite busy over the holiday period this year, and I would
like to be able to focus more on solving the puzzles than learning a new language!
